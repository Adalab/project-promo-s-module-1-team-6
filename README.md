#The Pushear Team
For our first module, our team needed to create a web page using a design that was provided to us. The main goal of the project was to consolidate the different concepts we learned during the first module, which consisted of: HTML, CSS, responsive design, GitHub Pages, Sass, grid and gulp. In addition to the project itself, it was important to implement Scrum in which we used the Agile core-values.
